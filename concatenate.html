            I noticed that it didn't add and it instead just combined the 2 numbers together.
            I said this before in class about some extra credit but it did that since the prompt is a string and isn't a variable where it can get a number. 
            For example, in Java, int is for whole number, string is for ASCII characters, double is for decimal numbers and in this code, it's basically asking for ASCII characters
            and not a number so that's why it combines it instead of adding it.
